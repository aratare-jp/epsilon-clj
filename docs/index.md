# Welcome!

`epsilon-clj` is a codebase generator based on [Eclipse Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/), written in Clojure
and thus sprinkled with sweetness.

It is created to help you develop applications faster, and more importantly, have fun while doing it. It does so by:

- Being _fast_ so you can do more things
- Being _hot-reloadable_ so you can code at your own speed
- Being _reliable_ so you don't have to fight the tool
- Being _consistent_ so you can get the same result no matter where you use it

If you are new to Clojure, no worries. You don't need to know the language to use this library.

If you're new to codebase generator, also no worries. I'll cover more in-depth concepts in later sections.

This entire documentation website has been designed to give you a more hands-on experience, and thus to familiarise you
with new concepts without overwhelming you üòâüëç
